Here are some examples of common dotfiles, e.g. .zprofile, that can get you started at
nutrien.  Ideas and PR welcomed.

## installation
This isn't something that you just install and go.  But requires editing for your username and configuration


### manually copy
clone this and copy the files to your home directory as needed.

### symbolic links only
    edit the files and use symbolic links to them.
    ln -s <file in dotfile dir>  <desired symbolic link>
    example:  `ln -s ~/dotfiles_nutrien/gitconfig .gitconfig

### fork this repo and make it your own
fork this repo, and change it, add to it.  Update it with your user info.  Use
symbolic links, add an install file

## What's in here
    * sample gitconfig
    * sample zsh files
